# Finplan-Logic-Test
How do you run this code?
So basically, you can use any tools you want as long as it can run the file with format .ipynb. But, I would suggest you to use Google Colab instead, as I wrote the whole content using it. Another thing as a reminder that it is actually so low the chances of you will get problem when inputting any input as I have also provided well-inputted information about what you can input, etc.
Thank you.
