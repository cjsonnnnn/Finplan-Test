# Finplan-Change-Profile-Test
How do you run this website?
The initial file is named "fip-profile.html", which from that you will experience the process of changing or rather adding a profile picture. But, once the profile picture is changed, there is no way going back to the initial condition again because the feature to delete installed picture is not available yet.
Thank you.

# Finplan-Logic-Test
How do you run this code?
So basically, you can use any tools you want as long as it can run the file with format .ipynb. But, I would suggest you to use Google Colab instead, as I wrote the whole content using it. Another thing as a reminder that it is actually so low the chances of you will get problem when inputting any input as I have also provided well-inputted information about what you can input, etc.
Thank you.
