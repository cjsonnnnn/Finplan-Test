# Finplan-Change-Profile-Test
How do you run this website?
The initial file is named "fip-profile.html", which from that you will experience the process of changing or rather adding a profile picture. But, once the profile picture is changed, there is no way going back to the initial condition again because the feature to delete installed picture is not available yet.
Thank you.
